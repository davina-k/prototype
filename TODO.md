TODO

- add an  "if [Application] already installed, print "[Application] is already installed"" into the logging for debugging
- comment out each install individually and run (done for all except cxedge)
- update cxedge run with new install documentation
- update install.yml so pre-running, it checks for all requirements (/vars/main.yml)
-   (or add vars separately within each task?? idk if that's less efficient, tbd)
- update README with how to install ansible, and any troubleshooting tips
  - making sure requirements are installed
  - running with sudo
  - running with --ignore-errors
  - in detail commands for downloading and using the playbook start 2 finish
